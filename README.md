# LED-Music-Commission

I was comissioned to create this project in 2020 and it involved creating a product that used an LED strip and 3D pritned figures from a video game series.

All files that I have provided do not contain the music and some images. This record is to show the code and not the media associated with it.

One program shows a version without the LED functionality and the other coontains it.
